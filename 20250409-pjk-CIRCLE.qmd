## Forest-Based Bioeconomy {background-opacity=0.25 background-image="/assets/images/forwarder.jpeg" .center}

Transition from fossil-based economy to an economy built on bio-based material and fuel resources, but highly contested transition arena with competing visions

[@holmgren2022WhoseTransformationThis]{.slide-cite}

## Directionality in Innovation Systems

Directionality as **possibility** [@stirling2023TransformingImaginationsMultiple], **normative governance** [@degraaff2025PoliticsDirectionalityInnovation] and **systemic outcomes** [@andersson2021OutcomesDirectionalityMorphology].

## RQ {.center}

<!-- The aim of this article is to provide a deeper understanding of the emerging Swedish bioeconomy by investigating (1) who are the key actors, and (2) how they have shaped the direction of the Swedish bioeconomy to date. Understanding by whom and how the Swedish bieconomy is shaped and institutionalized will fill an important knowledge gap and can help to open up the (forest) bioeconomy debate for discussion, contestation and remaking. -->

## Bioeconomy Innovation Has Declined After 1970s

![a. A total number of innovation registered in SWINNO database. b. Forest-based bioeconomy innovations registered in SWINNO database. c. Percentage of forest based bioeconomy innovations to total innovation registered in SWINNO database. Shown are the 5 year moving averages for each time series.](results/figures/fig_innovation_trends.svg){#fig-innovation-trends}


:::notes
Querying the SWINNO database for forest based bioeconomy innovations **initially yields 817 innovations**.False positives were removed from the dataset during classification, resulting in **811 innovations** which originate from, are used in, or make use of products derived from the forest.

# Take Aways

1. [The bioeconomy is declining]{.text-royal-blue-600} relative to total innovation, casting doubts on the overall transition to a bioeconomy.

1. [Bioresource Vision strongest among commercialized innovation]{.text-royal-blue-600}, but overlap between visions and open development paths.
   
1. [Discourse dominance and innovation output likely strongly intertwined]{.text-royal-blue-600}, but other drivers of innovation matter at least as much.
