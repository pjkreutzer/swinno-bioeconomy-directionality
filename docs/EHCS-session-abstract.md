<!-- Abstract 1:
The Swedish forestry sector has undergone a significant transformation towards a bioeconomy in recent years. This paper presents an economic history analysis of the sector's innovation activity since the 1970s in regards to the three bioeconomy visions: biotechnology, bioresource and bioecology vision. By examining innovation trends and policy developments, we shed light on which vision the Swedish innovation system is pursuing in the forestry sector. Our findings reveal that while the biotechnology vision dominated innovation activity in the past, there has been a significant shift towards the bioresource and bioecology visions in recent years.

Abstract 2:
The bioeconomy has emerged as a new economic paradigm that prioritizes sustainable and renewable resources. The Swedish forestry sector, which accounts for a significant share of the country's economy, has been at the forefront of this transition. This paper presents an economic history analysis of the sector's innovation activity since the 1970s in regards to the three bioeconomy visions: biotechnology, bioresource and bioecology vision.

Abstract 4:
The Swedish forestry sector is positioning itself at the forefront of the transition to a bioeconomy both nationally and internationally.
A bioeconomy suggests replacements of fossil based inputs with inputs from biological sources.
But the suggested transition goes deeper than input substitution, requiring novel configurations of economic structures and processes.
A contested debate between different visions of future bioeconomies has emerged in related policy, industry and scholarly arenas.
Previous discourse analysis has shown that the debate is dominated by economic visions centered around bioresources and biotechnology.

However, there is a lack of research on which direction the transition to a bioeconomy is actually taking. To address this gap, this paper uses newspaper reports about significant Swedish innovations found in the SWINNO database. The paper maps each innovation related to the forest sector between 1970 and 2020 to the bioeconomy visions it aims to realize. This mapping is based on previous definitions of each bioeconomy vision.

Conceptualizing innovation as embedded ideas sheds light on the actual direction the transition to a bioeconomy is taking, moving beyond statements of intent. Qualitatively labeling innovation data with bioeconomy visions allows us to advance the bioeconomy debate by making lock-ins into single visions testable and examining trade-offs as well as potential synergies between innovation aimed at different visions

The bioeconomy case study further highlights the importance and challenge of analyzing innovation in the context of sustainability transitions beyond efficiency gains or pollution reductions.
