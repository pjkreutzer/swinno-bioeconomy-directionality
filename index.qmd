## RQ {.center}

[1.]{.text-gray-600} [How many innovations are commercialized in this new economy]{.text-royal-blue-600}, especially considering the central role of innovation in bioeconomy discourse?

[2.]{.text-gray-600} What does commercialized innovation suggest for the [positive directionality of the bioeconomy transition]{.text-royal-blue-600}?

# Outlook & Aims {.inverted}

## Sharpen Analytical Focus on Directionality

To what extent is there a tension between the normative (desired) and positive (observed) directionality in the transition to a bioeconomy?

How does positive directionality shape normative directionality?

# Take Aways

1. [The bioeconomy is declining]{.text-royal-blue-600} relative to total innovation

2. [Positive directionality towards bioresource vision]{.text-royal-blue-600}, but overlap between visions and open development paths
